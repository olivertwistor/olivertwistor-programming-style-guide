# How to read and use this template
The sections in this file (except this one) are intended to stay in the real 
*README.md*. Each section consists of a heading and describing text on what to 
write. Text within square brackets (*[* and *]*) denotes text you should 
replace, for example you should replace *[Project name]* with your project's 
name.

You may add more sections as you see fit, but you should probably not remove 
any sections without really good reasons, such as that they are not applicable 
to the kind of project you're creating.

When you're done with filling each section with your own content, remove this 
first section (so this file starts with a heading with your project name). 
Also, rename this file to *README.md*.

Good luck and have fun!

# [Project name]
In this first section, there should be a short(ish) description of the project 
and its purpose for existing. The heading should be the name of your project or 
application.

Readers of this file should be able to get the gist of what the project is all 
about and if it's something for them, just by having read this first section.

## Table of contents
* [Who is this for?](#who-is-this-for)
* [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
* [Installation instructions](#installation-instructions)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Licensing](#licensing)
* [How to contribute](#how-to-contribute)
* [Versioning](#versioning)

## Who is this for?
A description of the intended type of users should be here. Is this a nice time 
saver for sysadmins, or an extensive library for graphical programmers? Maybe 
it's an application intended for end-users.

## Prerequisites
If there are any prerequisites in order for your project to work, they should 
be listed here.

Examples of prerequisites are:

* operating systems and environments this project can be run on
* code libraries that needs to be installed prior to this project
* software that is needed, in case of your project being a plugin, adapter, 
theme or anything else that is meant to extend the functionality of some other 
application

Remember to be specific! Don't just write *Mac OS X*, *Java* or *ImageMagick*; 
write *Mac OS X 10.4*, *Java 1.8 or newer* or *ImageMagick 7.0.x* instead. 
Also, when applicable, I suggest you provide links to where to download these 
prerequisites.

The purpose of this section being so early in the readme file is so that the 
reader may quickly discover if they can use your project at all. For example, a 
Windows user may not even want to bother with an application that's only 
runnable on a Mac.

## Installation instructions
In this section, any instructions to install or set up this project should be 
explained. It could be as little as downloading and unzipping a ZIP file. 
Instructions could also be much more involved, for example:

* editing configuration files
* setting up a database
* compiling source code

## Usage
This section explains how to use this project. If it's a code library, please 
include some of the major classes and functions and how they work. If it's an 
application, please include how to start it as well as how to use the major 
parts of it.

## Licensing
Every project should strive for a license that is as permissive as possible, in 
order to provide the users with as much freedom as possible. This is even more 
important for library projects and such projects that are supposed to be 
included in other software.

If your project relies on third-party projects and that source code or binary 
files from those are included within your project, you have to state those 
licenses here, as well.

It's important to note that while the license should be as permissive as 
possible, you must take care to ensure its compatibility with any third-party 
licenses. Open source licensing can be tricky. Please refer to [David A. 
Wheeler's license compatibility chart][1] for more information on how to 
combine licenses.

I suggest using [The MIT License][2] if possible.

## How to contribute
In this section, you can point to a separate CONTRIBUTING.md file if you want. 
There is a [template for such a file][4] in this project, so if you want to use 
a separate file for how to contribute, please feel free to use that template.

If you want to write a very short paragraph or two, you could write it here. 
Otherwise I recommend you use a separate CONTRIBUTING.md file. Please note that 
all instructions on what to include in a *How to contribute* section or file is 
located in the aforementioned file.

## Versioning
Every project should use [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][3] for version numbering. 
Also, descriptions on what has changed between each release should be included, 
in a separate file called CHANGELOG.md. Please read through the file 
[CHANGELOG-template.md][5] for how that should look.
