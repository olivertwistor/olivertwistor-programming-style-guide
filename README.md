# Olivertwistor Programming Style Guide
This is a style guide for all my programming projects. It includes styles for code and documentation, as well as various inspections and templates for the IDE's I'm using.#licensing)

## Installation
You can either read all the documents in this repository [online on GitHub](https://github.com/olivertwistor/olivertwistor-programming-style-guide ) or [download them for offline use](https://github.com/olivertwistor/olivertwistor-programming-style-guide/releases).

## Usage
Follow the section *Installation*. In this project, each folder holds style guides etc. for one language, for example will you find everything PHP in the `php` folder. I use JetBrains' IDE's for almost everything, so you will find resources for those applications in the `jetbrains` folder.
