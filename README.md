# Olivertwistor Programming Style Guide
Hello! I am Johan Nilsson a.k.a. Olivertwistor. This is a style guide for all 
my programming projects. The purpose is threefold:

* to make it easier for me to start up a new project and have some boilerplate 
file organization, code standards and documentation ready from the beginning
* to make sure that all projects stay consistent between themselves in terms of 
style, form and structure
* to help contributors to know how to contribute in a way that is consistent 
with the project

I also happen to love to read style guides and documentation. :smile:

## Who is this for?
This style guide is mainly for me and anyone who is a contributor to any of the 
projects I've created.

## Usage
This style guide has several main sections: one section for general things that 
are independent of programming language (for example documents on how to write 
readme files); and several sections that are dependent on programming language. 
Under each main section, you'll find documents describing how to organize and 
name files, write classes and functions etc.

You can either read all the documents in this repository [online on Github][1] 
or [download them for offline use][2]. The available downloads will be both all 
the documents and divided into programming languages, which is handy if you 
would only be interested in the style guide for a particular programming 
language.

### Syntax in template files
To show which sections are meant to be preserved verbatim, which sections are meant as descriptions of what you should write yourself and which sections are instructions on how to read and write, different syntax for these sections will be used.

Sections that are meant as descriptions will be prepended with `WRITE YOURSELF: `. For example:

    WRITE YOURSELF: Here you should write a warm greeting.

Sections that are meant to be preserved verbatim will not have anything prepended or in any other way have any additional markers. For example:

    The open source community should be a welcoming place to all.
    
In case this syntax isn't possible (for example, in case of a sentence or a word meant as description in the middle of a section meant to be preserved verbatim, the more explicit `(WRITE YOURSELF) ... (/WRITE YOURSELF)`  

#### Verbatim sections
