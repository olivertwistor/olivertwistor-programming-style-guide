# Olivertwistor Programming Style Guide
Hello! I am Johan Nilsson a.k.a. Olivertwistor. This is a style guide for all my programming projects. The purpose is threefold:

* to make it easier for me to start up a new project and have some boilerplate file organization, code standards and documentation ready from the beginning
* to make sure that all projects stay consistent between themselves in terms of style, form and structure
* to help contributors to know how to contribute in a way that is consistent with the project

I also happen to love to read style guides and documentation. :smile:

## Who is this for?
This style guide is mainly for me and anyone who is a contributor to any of the projects I've created.

## Usage
This style guide has several main sections: one section for general things that are independent of programming language (for example documents on how to write readme files); and several sections that are dependent on programming language. Under each main section, you'll find documents describing how to organize and name files, write classes and functions etc.

You can either read all the documents in this repository [online on Github][1] or [download them for offline use][2]. The available downloads will be both all the documents and divided into programming languages, which is handy if you would only be interested in the style guide for a particular programming language.
