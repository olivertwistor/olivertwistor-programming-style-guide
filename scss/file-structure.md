# File structure for SCSS files

Whenever I use [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) I like to work with multiple source files, according to the following table.

| File              | Contents                             |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| `_structure.scss` | Structural selectors such as _body_, |
